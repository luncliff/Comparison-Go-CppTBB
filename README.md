## Abstract
Applying concurrent structure and parallel processing are a common issue for these dayâ€™s programs. In this research, Dynamic Programming is used to compare the parallel performance of Go language and Intel C++ Thread Building Blocks. The experiment was performed on 4 core machine and its result contains execution time under Simultaneous Multi-Threading environment. Static Optimal Binary Search Tree was used as an example. 
 
From the result, the speed-up of Go was higher than the number of cores, and that of TBB was close to it. TBB performed better in general, but for larger scale, Go was partially faster than the other.
